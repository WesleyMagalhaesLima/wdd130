        <p>Hello, my name is Wesley Magalhães Lima, I'm from São Paulo, Brazil.
            I would like to share a bit about who I am. I have a passion for sports, 
            ranging from MMA to soccer and sports in general. Furthermore, 
            I am a dedicated professional, working in one of the nation's largest aluminum production industries
            as an analyst in projects and processes within the PMO sector. 
            I am committed to improving and optimizing processes to drive efficiency.
            Outside of the workplace, I am married, and while we don't have children yet, we thoroughly enjoy our time together. 
            Additionally, I am continually developing myself academically and professionally.
            Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Development at Brigham Young University, 
            seeking to enhance my skills and knowledge in technology.
